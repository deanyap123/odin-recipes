    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>475 g unbleached white flour</li>
      <li>175 mL warm water</li>
      <li>60g butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>2.5 g baking powder</li>
      <li>5-6 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 large potato, peeled and diced small</li>
      <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix
        in the butter (or butter and lard) using a pastry blender or by hand
        until everything is incorporated and coarse, like wet sand. Add 3/4 of
        the warm water and using your hands or a fork, form the mixture into a
        dough that's not too sticky and not too dry. If it's too sticky, add
        more flour; if it's too dry, add more water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough on a floured surface for a few minutes until it's no
        longer sticky; the dough should feel smooth, elastic and not dry. Divide
        the dough up into 8-10 golfball-sized balls and arrange them on a baking
        sheet. Lightly dampen a tea towel with warm water, cover the dough and
        let it rest for 20 minutes while you make the taco filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up about 30 mL of corn oil in a non-stick pan on medium heat and
        fry the potatoes until they're soft but not crispy. Season the potatoes
        with salt and pepper to taste, then transfer them to a paper towel-lined
        plate. In the same pan, heat up another 30 mL of corn oil and fry the
        tomato, onion, and jalapeno until the onion begins to soften. Remove
        everything from the pan, set the food aside and keep everything warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, heat up some more oil (30 mL) and fry up the corn
        tortilla strips until they're crispy. Set the tortilla strips aside on a
        paper towel-lined plate and let them drain. Using the same pan, heat up
        about 30 g of butter and lightly scramble the eggs. Combine the tomato
        mixture, corn tortillas strips and eggs on a platter. Set aside and keep
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a combination of your hands and a rolling pin, shape the flour
        tortillas into thin round circles about 15 cm in diameter (now would be
        the time to use a tortilla press if you have one handy). Heat up a
        cast-iron skillet on medium heat (if you have some, you can add a small
        amount of bacon drippings to the skillet to cook the tortillas). Cook
        the tortillas until bubbles form and brown specks appear, about 1
        minute. Turn over and cook the other side for about another minute.
        Continue cooking all the flour tortillas in the same manner. Keep
        tortillas warm, stacking them one on top of the other until ready to
        serve. Do not allow to dry out - use a dampened tea towel or a tortilla
        warmer if you have one to keep the tortillas pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide the potato/egg mixture onto the flour tortillas. Fold
        in half and eat.
